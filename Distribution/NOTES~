* frequency distribution;
  counts how often a certain verb appeared with a certain frame in the
  training corpus
* original probability distribution; based on the frame frequencies
* sharpened probability distribution;
  frequencies are squared first before creating the prob-distrib;
  reinforces the usage or non-usage of frames
* original binary distribution;
  value is 1 if frame probability is > 1% (and PP probability in
  version 2 is > 20%)
* sharpened binary distribution;
  same cut-offs on sharpened prob-distrib
* association values;
  according to Resnik:97 I defined
    assoc(verb,frame) = p(frame|verb) * log( p(frame|verb) / p(frame) )
  and used the association values for the distribution
* selectional preferences;
  for normalisation, I included the selectional preference into the
  association value:
    sel-pref(verb) = sum_{frame_i} assoc(verb,frame_i)
  and calculated
    assoc'(verb,frame) = 1/sel-pref(verb) * assoc(verb,frame)
